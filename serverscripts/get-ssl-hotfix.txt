GetSSL Hotfix

Search for "checking DNS"
Scroll back up to the line reading rr=${2}
Change that line to read rr=_acme-challenge.${2}

This will force the script to specifically look for the record called _acme-challenge on our GoDaddy registrar.

Then, running sudo ./getssl tasvideos.org should cause the script to read from the correct location, so that they can verify our TXT value.

Then, certs should work again.
